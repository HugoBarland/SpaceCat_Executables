# SpaceCat_Executables

(THIS IS NOT THE SOURCE CODE)
Due to size limitations and considering this is not even the source code, I decided to upload the project in a Google Drive. Read the instructions on how to run the game bellow.

(WINDOWS INSTRUCTIONS)

1) Decompress Zip file.
2) To run the application, click on the executable named "SpaceCat" with a Unity logo next to it.


(MAC INSTRUCTIONS)

1) Decompress Zip file.
2) To run the application first we have to give permission to be run in the system, open the terminal and type:

	    chmod -R 777 (followed by the path to the MacBuildV1_4.app file)

3)Then right-click on the executable named "MacBuildV1_4.app", select "open", a small window will pop-up, hit "open" again and the game should be able to run.

Note: 
I have decided not to include the source code of this project in my Github for security reasons, but to whoever is interested on knowing how the database of the leaderboard was implemented in the game or how the sections of the game work, I will be happy to share that and even show the source code.
